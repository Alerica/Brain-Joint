# Burger Joint üçî 

**Burger Joint** is a simple, fun **burger-cooking simulation game** made in Unity. You play as a burger chef fulfilling customer orders as efficiently as possible. The game was developed as a way to explore **customer behavior systems**, **Scriptable Objects**, and **interactive gameplay mechanics** in Unity.

## Gameplay Overview üçü 

- **Customers** arrive randomly and display their burger orders.
- The player prepares burgers using the correct ingredients and serves them before the customer runs out of patience.
- The system uses **Scriptable Objects** to store different customer types.
